# emu-coop-plus

emu-coop-plus is a Zelda 1 focused expansion of Andi McClure's emu-coop. It lets two players synchronize game state over the internet so single-player games can be played cooperatively across emulators and hardware.

For the v2.0 release line, the core goal is endpoint interoperability: FCEUX, EverDrive Pro N8, and MiSTer can all participate in the same relay/session system. A player on MiSTer can pair with a player on FCEUX, an EDN8 player can pair with a MiSTer player, two hardware players can pair with each other, and FCEUX-to-FCEUX still works.

Mode files are programs, like `.exe` files. Do not install a mode file unless it came from someone you know and trust.

## Supported Endpoints

| Endpoint | How it connects | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| FCEUX | Lua scripts from the emulator package | Uses `coop.lua` inside FCEUX. |
| EverDrive Pro N8 / real NES | PC hardware bridge | The bridge patches/uploads the ROM and talks to the cart over USB. |
| MiSTer | PC hardware bridge plus custom NES core | The bridge deploys `NES_emu-coop.rbf`, starts `mister-helper.py`, and stages ROMs over SSH/SCP. |

Any two endpoints can pair together as long as both clients use a compatible release and the same mode:

- FCEUX <-> FCEUX
- FCEUX <-> EDN8
- FCEUX <-> MiSTer
- EDN8 <-> MiSTer
- EDN8 <-> EDN8
- MiSTer <-> MiSTer

The bridge currently supports the Zelda 1 modes `tloz_basic`, `tloz_progress`, and `tloz_all`.

## Connectivity

Older emu-coop releases used IRC as the network backbone. emu-coop-plus replaces that with client-agnostic transports:

- **Relay**: both players connect outbound to a small Python relay daemon. This is the normal internet play path and requires no port forwarding.
- **Direct**: peer-to-peer TCP. This is useful for LAN play or private networks such as Tailscale, ZeroTier, or Hamachi.

The relay protocol is endpoint-neutral. FCEUX Lua clients and hardware bridge clients use the same session-code workflow, so the relay does not care whether a peer is FCEUX, EDN8, MiSTer, or a future client.

Self-hosters can run their own relay; see [relay/README.md](relay/README.md).

## PC Hardware Bridge

The hardware bridge is the Windows app that makes real hardware feel like another emu-coop endpoint.

For **EverDrive Pro N8**, the bridge:

- Validates and patches the user's Zelda 1 ROM.
- Uploads the patched ROM to the EDN8 over USB.
- Reads and writes game memory through the EDN8 USB protocol.
- Joins the shared relay session as a normal peer.

For **MiSTer**, the bridge:

- Connects to MiSTer over SSH using the user-provided host/IP.
- Deploys the custom `NES_emu-coop.rbf` NES core without overwriting the stock `NES.rbf`.
- Deploys and starts `mister-helper.py`.
- Stages source ROMs under `/media/fat/games/NES/emu-coop-plus/`.
- Reads and writes NES memory through the MiSTer helper/core path.

For bridge details, see [bridge/README.md](bridge/README.md).

## Quick Start

### FCEUX

1. Download and extract the FCEUX zip that matches your FCEUX bitness: `fceux-win32.zip` for 32-bit FCEUX or `fceux-win64.zip` for 64-bit FCEUX.
2. Launch FCEUX and load your Zelda 1 ROM.
3. From the FCEUX Lua menu, load `coop.lua`.
4. Choose Relay or Direct, enter the agreed session code, and select the same Zelda 1 mode as your partner.

FCEUX native Lua modules must match the emulator process bitness. Running the 32-bit package under 64-bit FCEUX, or the 64-bit package under 32-bit FCEUX, can fail with a native DLL load error such as `iuplua.dll: %1 is not a valid Win32 application`.

Some 64-bit FCEUX builds run Lua on a thread where IUP cannot open the connection dialog. If the log says `Must call iup.Open in main thread`, edit `coop_config.lua` in the extracted FCEUX package, set `enabled = true`, enter the shared relay session code, save, and reload `coop.lua`.

### EverDrive Pro N8

1. Download and run the hardware bridge.
2. Choose `EverDrive Pro N8`.
3. Select your Zelda 1 ROM.
4. Let the bridge patch and upload the ROM to the cart.
5. Choose the same relay/session code and mode as your partner.

### MiSTer

1. Download and run the hardware bridge.
2. Choose `MiSTer`.
3. Enter the MiSTer host/IP, username, and password.
4. Let the bridge deploy the custom core, helper, and ROM.
5. Launch the deployed `NES_emu-coop` core and staged ROM, then connect with the same relay/session code and mode as your partner.

## Project Layout

- `modes/`: original Lua mode files used by FCEUX-side emu-coop.
- `bridge/`: Python hardware bridge, GUI, CLI, EDN8 support, MiSTer support, and bridge tests.
- `relay/`: relay daemon for internet sessions.
- `mister/`: vendored MiSTer NES core project and build notes for `NES_emu-coop.rbf`.
- `dist/emu/`: FCEUX release packages.
- `dist/hardware/`: hardware bridge release packages.

## Development

Build all distributables:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-all.ps1
```

Run bridge tests:

```powershell
cd bridge
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Build the MiSTer core payload:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-mister-core.ps1
```

## Roadmap

Planned work after the v2.0 stabilization push:

- Add more gameplay modes, including DIBS-style competitive Zelda 1 modes once the bridge-side sync engine supports their extra write semantics cleanly.
- Add additional emulator endpoints, with BizHawk and Mesen as likely next targets.
- Continue reducing setup friction for hardware players.
